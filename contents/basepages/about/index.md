### History of GCES and IT expo

Gandaki College of Engineering and Science (GCES) is a tertiary educational
institution situated in Lamachaur, Pokhara. The college was established in the year
1999 as an extension of Gandaki Boarding School and is affiliated to the Pokhara
University. The college strives to provide high-quality technical education in the
field of ICT. At present, the college provides a 4-year Bachelor's Degree in
Software Engineering and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.

It has been our tradition to organize IT Expo in GCES. We have already organized
the GCES IT Expo in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. We feel we
could achieve a lot through those festive events. We could create awareness to a
huge mass and we could also demonstrate our software products both the research
types and the products that could be easily fit into our Nepalese context. Those
activities really had a profound impact to promote the use and development of the
IT sector in Nepal. Encouraged by past achievements, as a responsible factor for
national developments and to address the need of the time, we are organizing the
IT Expo again this year too. We believe this will provide outstanding achievement
in the field of Information Technology.

## GCES IT Expo 2020

Gandaki College of Engineering and Science (GCES) is organizing "GCES IT
Expo 2020" for two days on 15th and 16th February 2020 (3rd to 4th Falgun 2076)
in the college premise itself at Lamachaur, Pokhara. GCES IT Expo is all about
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) exhibitions and awareness
programs. The exhibition is aimed at creating awareness about Information and
Communication Technologies and newer and emerging tools of the IT industry,
and how they can fit in our society and how can we benefit from IT in
organizations, government offices, educational institutions and our day to day life.
It will address many more challenges that our society has been facing without IT.
ICT presents itself as an effective and affordable solution to overcome the
socioeconomic imbalance due to the geographical remoteness of Nepal. But due to
a lack of awareness, these technologies are not exploited. GCES promotes ICT by
showcasing the latest hardware and software products, Free Software Projects, and
other related technologies.

The IT Expo will attract Secondary School students, 10+2 students, college and
university students, entrepreneurs, professionals, enthusiasts, and the IT business
personals as well as the general public. The major highlights of the exhibition will
be Technology Demonstrations, Technical Talks, Documentaries, Software
Development Contests, Quiz Competitions, and so on.

    development of Nepal.
